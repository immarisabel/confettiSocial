Inbox Endpoint URL: `https://social.marisabel.nl/inbox.`

- [ ] Implement the Inbox Handler: Create a handler or controller in your application code to handle incoming POST requests to the inbox endpoint.This handler will process the incoming activities and take appropriate actions based on the type of activity received.
- [ ] Handle Authentication: Implement authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized requests are accepted at the inbox endpoint. This may involve verifying signatures on incoming activities or using OAuth tokens for authentication.
- [ ] Parse Incoming Activities: Parse the JSON payload of incoming POST requests to extract the ActivityStreams activities. ActivityStreams is the data format used by ActivityPub for representing social activities.
- [ ] Process Incoming Activities: Based on the type of activity received (e.g., Follow, Create, Like), implement logic to process the activity and take appropriate actions. For example, if the activity is a follow request, you'll need to establish a follower-following relationship between users.
- [ ] Send Responses: After processing the incoming activity, send an appropriate response back to the sender, indicating whether the activity was successfully processed or if there was an error.
- [ ] Testing: Test your inbox endpoint by sending test activities from another ActivityPub-compliant server. Verify that your server receives the activities and processes them correctly, and that responses are sent back as expected.
